SEISMIC identifies genomic regions where mutations are positively selected in cancer genomes, by analysing the distribution of mutations across the cohort.

## System Requirements

SEISMIC can be run on a computer or server running Linux, preferably with a decent amount of RAM (at least 32 GB). R is required (version 4.1.0 tested), as well as the following R packages (tested versions in parentheses):
- `tidyverse` (1.3.1)
- `yaml` (2.3.5)
- `foreach` (1.5.2)
- `doParallel` (1.0.17)
- `stringi` (1.7.6)
- `inline` (0.3.19)
- `Rcpp` (1.0.8.3)
- `fitdistrplus` (1.1.8)
- `data`.table (1.14.2)
- `plyranges` (1.14.0)
- `BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19` (1.4.3)


## Installation

To use the SEISMIC script, simply clone this repository, and run it according to the usage instructions below.
There is an installation script for the required R packages (`demo/install_R_dependencies.R`) that can be sourced from the R console to install the most recent versions. The installation takes approximately 30 minutes if no packages were installed previously.


## Demo
There is a demo script (demo/run_demo.sh) that uses SEISMIC to analyse TCGA UCEC SNVs in gene CDSs. Before running this script, make sure to install the required R packages (see above). SEISMIC will use the settings in `demo/demo_config.yaml`. If the machine running the demo has ample RAM, multi-threading can be enabled by changing the "cores" value in the config file to speed up analysis. For reference, 5-10 GB of RAM may be used per thread.

The demo script first generates the required mutation effect annotation file (\~15 min, using \~25 GB RAM), and then runs SEISMIC (1 h 40 min using \~75 GB RAM running on 10 threads on our system). The expected output is the file `demo/output/SEISMIC_demo_UCEC_WXS_result__unadjusted_bkg_mutrate_cohort_sig_UCEC_min_3_muts_10000_sims.tsv`, with genes listed by P value and the same results as in the UCEC analysis in the paper.


## Usage

```bash
Rscript SEISMIC.R config.yaml
```

### Config file

The SEISMIC script requires a yaml config file to run. A template config file with default values is supplied in `config/config_template.yaml`, annotated with explanations of the variables.


### Preparation

The SEISMIC script currently requires a file with effect annotations (e.g., mismatch, nonsense, synonymous) for mutations in each region (typically gene CDSs) to be analysed. This file can be generated by running one of the annotate scripts in the data directory.

Mutations (SNVs) currently need to be pyrimidine-focused with tab-separated values and the following columns (column names at the top of the file):
- `seqnames`: chromsome name (e.g., chr1)
- `start`: 1-based position of mutation (hg19)
- `end`: 1-based position of mutation (hg19)
- `strand`: strand of the pyrimidine in the reference sequence
- `cancer`: cancer type. Multiple cancer types in one file works.
- `gene`: gene name
- `trinuc`: trinucleotide at mutated position (NYN)
- `refnuc`: reference nucleotide (Y)
- `varnuc`: variant nucleotide
- `sampleID`: patient ID

A file with background trinucleotide frequencies in the regions covered by the mutations is required. Files suitable for whole-exome and whole-genome mutations are available in the data directory.

A file with region definitions for the regions to be analysed is required. The files used for gene CDSs, promoters, and introns in the paper are available in the data directory.

When running SEISMIC with mutation expectation scaling to replication timing or expression, the relevant files are available in the data directory. Please note that this is only relevant when analysing recurrence as well as cohort distribution, and not required for normal use as in the paper.
